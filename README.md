# emoji_trivia

This is a website I made for a school project. It is a trivia game where the user has to guess what the movie is based on the emojis. 
I use localStorage to store the scores and create a leaderboard. In order to make the questions random every time, I created a dictionary with objects and values.

Test your movie and emoji knowledge with this fun website!
